While looking through Glassdoor's online job postings, I saw the job opening at <Company> and was highly motivated by the opportunity. I am very interested in your <position> position, and I believe that my background aligns greatly with <Company>'s culture and that my education, leadership opportunities and technical experience make me a strong candidate for this position.

Throughout my undergrad, I was able to maintain high academic standards while getting myself involved in as much extracurricular activities as possible. These include but are not limited to joining McGill Robotics’ business and technical teams, joining the board of the McGill Egyptian Students’ Association, participating in several hackathons and coding competitions (winning several awards), working in technical positions during the summer, as well as playing basketball in McGill’s intramurals league every semester. 
These activities helped me gain extremely valuable personal, technical and leadership experiences. They helped me gain exceptional organizational, time management and communications skills, outstanding work ethics and the ability to work well in a team.

I would welcome an opportunity to meet with you to discuss my qualifications and candidacy in further detail. Thank you for your consideration.
